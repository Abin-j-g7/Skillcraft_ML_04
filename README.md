🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition Model
📌 Overview

This project implements a Hand Gesture Recognition System that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from images. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on a dataset of hand gesture images.

The goal of this project is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

📂 Dataset
